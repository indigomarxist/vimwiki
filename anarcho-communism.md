# anarcho-communism

  * A theory of anarchism which advocates the immediate abolition of the state, capitalism, wage labour, and private property (while retaining respect for personal property), and in favor of common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy, and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need". Primarily based on the ideas of Kropotkin.
