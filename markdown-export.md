Markdown export

If you use markdown as the syntax for your wiki, there is a rubygem available
at https://github.com/patrickdavey/vimwiki_markdown which you can use to
convert the wiki markdown files into html.

Also, See |vimwiki-option-html_filename_parameterization| for supporting
functionality.
